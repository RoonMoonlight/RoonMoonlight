### 'Do NOT fork'
* Do NOT fork if you are not just going to improve or fix it.
* Do NOT delete the fork for no reason.
* Do NOT fork if you do not fully understand how does this thing works.

I have noticed many of people does not follow these when forking as a seperate project, so I decided to make advices above.
